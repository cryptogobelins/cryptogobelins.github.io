                    <h2>About this item</h2>
                    <em>Cats in Winter</em> extends the feline motif of the first NFT token in the collection, now with a wintery atmosphere.

                    <p>This NFT will have exactly 4 copies, which will be uniquely identified by an "Edition" property.</p>

                    <p>In its physical form, the tapestry has a length of 16.7cm and a height of 22cm. Its canvas is 215x264mm.</p>

                    <h2>What are Gobelins?</h2>
                    <p>Gobelins are a form of tapestry (textile art) created by manually weaving colored threads using a needle. Typically, the gobelins are woven into a special canvas which has a 10-by-10 grid. Each individual point on the canvas is 1mm by 1mm in size, representing the smallest unit.</p>

                    <p>Gobelins are usually made from a diagram, some of which are paid or free. However, the end result is a unique piece of art because they are made by people of different skill and with different colored threads and canvases.</p>

                    <h2>The CryptoGobelins Collection</h2>
                    The <em>CryptoGobelins Collection</em> is a collection of home-made, hand-sewn gobelins that are minted as NFTs. The gobelins were scanned at 300 and 600 DPI which will be available as unlocked content. The images are not processed in any way.

                    <p>Since our gobelins are hand-made by exactly one artist, there is only one physical copy of each of the NFTs in the collection. The physical copy will never be sold outside of the collection, however it might be possible in the future to sell the original physical copy to one of the buyers of the NFTs.</p>
